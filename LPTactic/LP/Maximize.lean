/-! ## Forward-direction `maximize` tactic.

`maximize <expr>` and `maximize h : <expr>` take a linear `Rat` expression
and inject `have h : <expr> ≤ N := <proof>` where `N` is the certified
optimum of `<expr>` over the local non-strict linear hypotheses.

Architecturally this is a *forward-direction surface* on top of the same
sup-LP construction the x-independent inner-`∀` path uses — that path
substitutes a residual row into a witness LP, while `maximize` injects
the bound as a new hypothesis. The proof of `expr ≤ N` is built by
reusing `proveEntailed` with `rhs := mkRatLit N`: `direct_le_close` is
the closing lemma; the Farkas-multiplier weighting against the original
hypothesis terms is the binder/vector mapping; and `normalizeR` is the
surface-form reflection.

Verified-outcome dispatch:
- `.optimal x* d`: recompute `N = exprLin.evalAt vars x*` in Lean (the
  primal is trusted only as a vector of `Rat` literals; SoPlex's reported
  objective value is not used). Then call `proveEntailed` to build a
  proof of `expr ≤ N` against the original hypothesis terms.
- `.infeasible d`: hypotheses are inconsistent. Reuse
  `tryHypsInconsistent` to derive `False` from the dual, then close the
  *surrounding goal* by `False.elim` (the only branch where `maximize`
  touches the goal).
- `.unbounded …`: the sup is `+∞`. Fail with the canonical
  "verified unbounded" message.
- any other status: fail with the canonical "unchecked" message.

Strict-hypothesis rejection is inherited from `collectHyps`: strict
hypotheses throw at parse time before any LP call. -/
