not itself a comparison (e.g. `False`) from inconsistent hypotheses. Inspects the
RAW type — `whnfR` may unfold `LE.le` for `Rat` into a `Bool` equality and hide
the real carrier. -/

/-- A comparison goal `lhs op ?m` (or `?m op rhs`) one side of which is a bare unassigned
metavariable: `linarith` closes these by *assigning* the metavariable, rather than by
proving an entailment. Faced with `concrete = ?m` it picks the value `v` the hypotheses
force `concrete` to equal and assigns `?m := v`; faced with the strict `m < ?m` it finds a
hypothesis-derived upper bound `v` (`m < v`) and assigns `?m := v`. The chosen `v` is always
an existing context term (e.g. `?m := p` when `n + n' = p` reduces `m + -1 + n'` to `p`, or
`?m := d` for `m < d`), NOT the verbatim `concrete` side. That distinction matters: the
assigned value flows on into the surrounding elaboration (e.g. it fixes the degree of a
cochain a later `simp` lemma must match), so a verbatim assignment would type-check the
comparison yet derail the surrounding proof. `lp` otherwise atomizes `?m` as an opaque
carrier term and rejects it.

We mirror `linarith` by *searching* the carrier-typed local variables for a `v` making the
oriented comparison (`concrete = v`, `concrete < v`/`v < concrete`, or the `≤` analogue)
provable, reusing `solveAtomic` as the prover (so the strict witness search inherits the
ℕ→ℤ cast bridging that proves `m < d` from `ℤ`-cast hypotheses), then assigning `?m := v`.
Returns `true` when handled. Each attempt runs inside a saved state that is rolled back on
failure, so a candidate that partially solves (or whose defeq checks assign shared
metavariables) before throwing cannot leak that into the next attempt or the surrounding
proof. -/
