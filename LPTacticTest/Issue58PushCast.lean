  Tests for issue #58 stage 3: `push_cast` normalization of casts.

  A cast `↑(a + b)` / `↑(a * b)` over `ℕ`/`ℤ` was one opaque atom for `lp`, so its linear
  structure — and any match against the goal's (or a lifted hypothesis') separately-cast
  columns — was invisible. `linarith` runs `push_cast` first; this is `lp`'s. It pairs with
  the stage-2 `zify` lift: a `ℕ` hypothesis `#B ≤ 2 * #A` lifts to `↑#B ≤ ↑(2 * #A)`, and
  `push_cast` then rewrites `↑(2 * #A) → 2 * ↑#A` so it lands on the goal's `2 * ↑#A` column.

  `pushCast?` (in `LP/Types.lean`) pushes a cast one step inward using the `Grind` ring cast
  lemmas — `↑(a + b) → ↑a + ↑b`, `↑(a * b) → ↑a * ↑b`, and for `ℤ` casts `↑(a - b) → ↑a - ↑b`,
  `↑(-a) → -↑a`, `↑↑n → ↑n` — and is shared by the parser (`parseInto`) and the certificate
  normalizer (`normalizeR`) in lockstep, like the stage-1 `distributeMul?`. The proof comes
  from the cast lemma and is `isDefEq`-checked against `↑inner = pushed`, so a cast whose
  instance does not line up with the lemma's fails closed to atomization (no unsoundness, no
  divergence between the two walks). A pushed product feeds the stage-1 distribution; a cast
  of a closed numeral folds to the carrier numeral (`↑(2 : ℕ) → (2 : α)`) — see
  `Issue69.lean`.

  These are ring IDENTITIES over `ℤ` (the `.int` engine) and `ℚ` (the `.rat` engine): both
  sides `push_cast`-normalize to the same linear form, so the objective residual is closed
  and the goal proves with zero rows — the full parser → normalizer → certificate path that
  `pushCast?` feeds, kernel-checked, no backend.

  Refinements left for a follow-up: the factor / coefficient-collapse case (`↑(2 * #A)`
  pushes to `↑2 * ↑#A`, whose surviving `↑2` is reached as a product factor via `parseScalar?`
  rather than the `pushCast?` hook — folding it there would need the per-carrier `proveLitEq`
  to bridge a cast literal `↑(2 : ℕ) = ⟦2⟧`; deferred since no resurvey site needs it, see
  `Issue69.lean`), and `ℤ`→`R` hypothesis lifting (the `IntCast` Grind/core diamond and a
  missing forward monotone lemma). The abstract-field cast path reuses this same
  carrier-generic `pushCast?` and the cast-lemma resolution validated in `Issue58Casts.lean`.
